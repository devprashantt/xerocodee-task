# Landing Page Redesign: Project X

### Overview
This project is a redesign of a landing page aimed at providing a sleek and intuitive interface for our product. The target audience is potential customers and users interested in our service. Notable features include a responsive layout, interactive elements, and clear call-to-action sections.

### Technologies Used
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework/Library**: Vite.js
- **Styling**: SCSS
- **Architecture**: MVVC (Model-View-ViewModel-Controller)
- **Testing**: Jest

### Design Decisions
The design was approached with a mobile-first perspective to ensure responsiveness across various devices. SCSS was chosen for its modularity, allowing for easier maintenance and organization of styling elements. Variables and mixins were heavily utilized to enhance code readability and reusability.

### Challenges Faced
Testing proved to be a significant challenge during this project. Setting up Jest and ensuring comprehensive coverage was a complex task. To mitigate this, I established a structured testing plan, focused on unit testing individual components and integration testing where necessary. Although time-consuming, this approach helped in achieving a reasonable testing coverage.

### Code Structure
The project follows a folder structure based on the MVVC architecture pattern. Components are organized based on their roles in the architecture. The separation of concerns was maintained, ensuring clear boundaries between the model, view, view-model, and controller aspects.

### Testing Approach
The testing strategy primarily revolved around Jest. To achieve testing coverage, I focused on unit testing individual components and performed integration testing for larger modules. The challenge was in setting up mocks and ensuring proper interaction testing. Continuous refinement of the testing strategy was key to achieving a balanced and comprehensive coverage.

### Running the Project Locally
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Access the application on your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Future Improvements
Potential improvements include enhancing testing coverage further and integrating Storybook for UI component documentation. Additionally, optimizing performance and exploring dynamic content loading for improved user experience are areas for future development.

### Acknowledgments
I'd like to acknowledge the Vite.js and Jest communities for their robust documentation and support in navigating through challenges during this project.

### Additional Notes
The project, though functional, remains open to enhancements and further refinement. Feel free to contribute and suggest improvements.
